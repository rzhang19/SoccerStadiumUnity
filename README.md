# SoccerStadiumUnity
Made in Unity with scripts for seat and railing generation

There are two zip files in this repository.
Both zips are from the same project, but have different (amounts of) material.

The models were created in Blender and carried over into Unity for the final production phase.

StadiumProject.zip contains the faster version of my project, but without any seats or railings generated.

SlowerStadium.zip contains the slower version of my project, and it contains seat and railing generation through C# scripts.
